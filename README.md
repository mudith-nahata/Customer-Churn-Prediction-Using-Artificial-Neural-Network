# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network

--> The Goal was to implement the artifical neural network, to know How neural networks are implemented, and how we are going to train the neural networks.

--> In this context I came across with the implementation using keras and how we can manipulate and calculate the weights of each input layer, and biases of each output layer and tried to fit the model  and calculated the accuracy of the Model.
